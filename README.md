# Git (VsGit) for VS Code

A full-featured, Git client for VS Code. VsGit spawns the `git`
binary directly — no libgit2, no reimplementation of git in JavaScript — and
surfaces **170+ commands** across every Git workflow through dedicated views,
webviews, and an interactive commit graph.

## Why VsGit

VS Code ships with a capable Source Control panel, but power users coming from
Eclipse's EGit, `gitk`, `git-cola`, or standalone graph tools often want more:
a real commit graph, worktrees, interactive rebase, LFS, notes, bisect, subtree,
Gerrit, and per-commit operations without dropping to a terminal.

VsGit fills that gap by driving the real `git` CLI. Because every operation is a
genuine `git` invocation, behaviour matches your shell exactly — the same
config, hooks, credential helpers, and aliases apply.

## Highlights

- 🌳 **Interactive commit graph** — an SVG-rendered DAG with colour-coded branch
  lanes, inline ref pills, an expand-in-place commit-details row, flow tracing,
  fuzzy find, and a full right-click action menu.
- 📜 **History view** — paginated log with the same robust graph renderer,
  branch/author/message/date filtering, and a Compare-Branches mode.
- 🗂️ **Rich sidebar** — Repositories, Staging, Synchronize, Conflicts, Reflog,
  Worktrees, and Compare trees, all multi-root aware.
- 🔁 **Native Source Control integration** — VsGit publishes real SCM resource
  groups for staged, working-tree, and merge changes so VS Code's Source
  Control panel gets VsGit menus, quick diff, and commit input support.
- ✍️ **Commit webview** — stage by hunk, GPG-sign, DCO sign-off, amend.
- 🔧 **Everything else** — interactive rebase, LFS, notes, bisect, subtree,
  archive, patch, Gerrit, submodules, and a built-in git-config editor.
- 🔒 **Safe by construction** — git is always spawned with an argv array (never a
  shell), refs are guarded against option injection, and the credential/editor
  IPC channels are authenticated with a per-session token.

## Screenshots

### Git Graph

![Git Graph panel](docs/git-graph.png)

Colour-coded lanes, `HEAD → main` / remote / tag ref pills, a selected-row
commit-details panel (metadata on the left, changed files on the right), and
Eclipse Git-style columns: **Graph · Description · Author · Authored Date · Committer ·
Committed Date · Commit**. Metadata columns are toggleable from the graph toolbar;
Authored Date and Committer are hidden by default.

### Activity bar & trees

![Sidebar views](docs/sidebar.png)

The VsGit container uses a git-merge style logo and hosts the Repositories
and Staging trees, among others.

## Views & features

### Repositories view
- Multi-root workspace support with per-repo ahead/behind indicators.
- Full tree of branches, remotes, tags, stashes, submodules, and worktrees.
- Inline checkout, push, pull, fetch, merge, and rebase from tree nodes.
- **Reset HEAD** submenu with all five git modes — soft, mixed, hard, keep, and
  merge — each picking the target ref and confirming before a hard reset.
- **Switch To** quick picker (`⌘⇧G B` / `Ctrl+Shift+G B`) across all branches and tags.
- Sequencer controls (Continue / Skip / Abort) appear automatically during an
  in-progress rebase, merge, cherry-pick, or revert.

### Staging view & Commit webview
- Staged / Changes / Conflicts groups.
- The active repository can be selected from the Repositories view; staging,
  synchronize, reflog, history, graph, and commit surfaces follow that selection.
- Changed files render as a collapsible **tree or flat list** (toggle persisted
  across sessions), with a descriptive status label per file.
- Hunk-level stage and unstage (forward/reverse patch apply to the index).
- **Reset Changes** on any unstaged file to revert it.
- Commit with **GPG sign** (`-S`) and **DCO sign-off** options, or **amend** the
  last commit (message prefilled).

### History view
- Paginated commit log (page size configurable) rendered with the shared,
  unit-tested graph layout — branch lanes stay connected across rows.
- Filter by branch, author, or message; restrict by date range.
- Per-commit context menu: checkout (detached), create branch/tag, cherry-pick,
  revert, reset (soft / mixed / hard / keep / merge), compare with HEAD or
  another commit, copy SHA, and show full details.
- **Compare Branches** mode for a symmetric `A...B` diff.
- Commits are loaded in `--topo-order` so a child always precedes its parents,
  which is what the lane layout needs to draw a correct graph.

### Git Graph
- SVG-rendered commit graph: one overlay path system spanning every row, so
  edges never break apart between rows.
- Inline ref labels, an expand-at-selection commit-details row, and
  `Ctrl/Cmd-click` to compare any two commits.
- **Flow tracing**: highlight ancestors / descendants of the selected commit.
- **Find** (`Ctrl/Cmd+F`) across message, author, hash, and ref names.
- Toolbar: per-repo Pull / Push / Fetch / Commit / Branch / Merge / Stash with
  ahead/behind badges, plus an in-progress operation banner.
- Right-click any commit or ref pill for the full action menu (checkout, branch,
  tag, merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, drop, reset, compare, copy SHA;
  branch/tag/stash management on ref pills).

### Compare view
- Side-by-side branch/ref comparison tree listing commits unique to each side
  and all changed files; click a file to open a diff.

### Synchronize view
- Incoming (behind) and outgoing (ahead) commits vs the configured upstream;
  right-click to cherry-pick or checkout any incoming commit.

### Conflict resolution
- Conflicts view lists every conflicted file with **Use Ours / Use Theirs /
  Open Merge Editor / Mark Resolved**, backed by VS Code's built-in 3-way merge.

### Reflog view
- Browse `git reflog` and checkout or reset to any entry.

## Advanced operations

| Feature | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Interactive Rebase** | Drag-and-drop todo editor with reword / squash / fixup / drop, edited entirely inside VS Code |
| **Worktrees** | Create, open, lock, unlock, remove, prune |
| **Git LFS** | Track, untrack, lock, unlock, list locks, pull, prune |
| **Git Notes** | Add, edit, remove, show per-commit notes |
| **Bisect** | Start, mark good/bad, reset, show log |
| **Subtree** | Add, pull, push, split |
| **Archive** | Create a zip/tar from any ref |
| **Patch** | Create from staged changes or commits, and apply patch files |
| **Gerrit** | Push for review, install the `Change-Id` commit-msg hook |
| **Submodules** | Add, update, sync, deinit |
| **Maintenance** | `git gc`, prune, fsck, and repo maintenance helpers |
| **Blame** | Toggleable inline blame annotations (`⌘⇧G A`) |
| **Tags** | Webview **Create Tag** dialog — name, message, and annotate / sign / force / push options in one form |
| **GitHub** | Fetch Pull Requests — pulls `refs/pull/*/head` as local refs |

Interactive rebase and commit-message editing are routed back into VS Code via a
small editor shim wired to `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` / `GIT_EDITOR`, so `git
rebase -i` opens a native editor instead of a terminal vi session.

## Architecture

```
src/
  extension.ts            activation: registers commands, views, providers
  git/
    GitExecutor.ts        the ONLY place git is spawned (argv array, no shell)
    Repository.ts         per-repo cached state + all git operations
    RepositoryManager.ts  multi-root discovery + change notifications
    GitContentProvider.ts vsgit: URIs that feed VS Code's diff editor
    argGuard.ts           option-injection guards (safeRef / safeRemoteUrl)
    parsers/              pure, unit-tested output parsers
                          (log, graphLog, status, refs, diff, blame, config,
                           reflog, rebaseTodo, worktree)
  views/                  tree data providers + native Source Control bridge
  webviews/               webview panels (Graph, History, Commit, Create Tag,
                          pickers)
  services/               auto-fetch, file-system watcher, status bar
  util/                   IPC servers (askpass / editor) + helpers (html escape)
resources/
  graphLayout.js          shared, unit-tested commit-graph layout (UMD)
  graph.js / graph.css    Git Graph panel client
  askpass.js              GIT_ASKPASS shim
  sequence-editor.js      GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR / GIT_EDITOR shim
  icon.svg                activity-bar logo
```

Key design points:

- **One spawn site.** Every git call funnels through `GitExecutor`, which uses
  `child_process.spawn(gitPath, args)` with an argv array — never a shell string.
- **Machine-readable output.** Operations request NUL-/porcelain-formatted output
  and parse it in small, pure functions under `git/parsers/`, each with tests.
- **One graph layout.** Both the Git Graph panel and the History view import the
  same `resources/graphLayout.js` (a UMD module that also loads in Node), so
  there is a single, verified implementation of lane layout and edge geometry.
- **Live refresh.** A file-system watcher plus `RepositoryManager.onDidChange`
  keep every view in sync after internal or external git changes.

## Security model

- **No shell.** Git is spawned with an argv array, so shell metacharacters
  (`;`, `|`, `$()`, backticks) are inert.
- **Option-injection guards.** Refs, SHAs, branch names, and remote URLs coming
  from webview messages or rendered commit data are validated by `safeRef` /
  `safeRemoteUrl`: values beginning with `-` (which git would parse as options)
  are rejected, as are the `ext::` / `fd::` remote-helper transports that can run
  arbitrary commands.
- **Authenticated IPC.** Credential prompts (`GIT_ASKPASS`) and rebase/commit
  editing run over a unix socket / named pipe whose name is enumerable by other
  local processes. Each session generates a random token, passed to the shim
  only via its environment; the server rejects any connection that doesn't echo
  it — preventing local credential phishing or edit injection. Credential
  prompts are masked unless they explicitly ask for a username.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run watch        # esbuild in watch mode; F5 launches the dev host
npm run check-types  # tsc --noEmit
npm run build        # production bundle into dist/
npm test             # compile + run the unit-test suite
```

### Testing

Tests run on Node's built-in test runner (`node --test`) — no VS Code instance
required. They cover the pure logic that's most worth pinning down:

- every output parser under `src/git/parsers/` (log, graph-log, status, refs,
  diff, blame, config, reflog, rebase-todo, worktree),
- the shared commit-graph layout (`resources/graphLayout.test.js`) and the
  Git Graph webview client (`resources/manifest.test.js`),
- the `GitExecutor` argv assembly and the `Repository` command builders,
- the argument guards, the HTML-escape helper, and the IPC token comparison.

```bash
npm test     # 142 tests
```

CI (GitHub Actions) runs type-check, build, the test suite, and packages the
VSIX on every push and pull request.
